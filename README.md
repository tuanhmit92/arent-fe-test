## Project Overview: Building a 3-Page Website using React.js

## Project Description:

This project involves creating a three-page website using React.js and Webpack bundle, following a predefined design. The website will consist of three pages: Top Page, My Record, and Column Page. Each page will have specific functionality and design elements as described in the provided markdown document. Additionally, dummy data will be generated to populate the pages for demonstration purposes.

## Page 1: Top Page

- Display a list of items.
- Implement a section for filtering the items based on certain criteria.

## Page 2: My Record

- Include three sections:
  1. A chart section displaying graphical data.
  2. A list section that can be scrolled vertically.
  3. A list section.

## Page 3: Column Page

- Present a column layout to list items from the provided data.

## Functionality:

1. **List and Filter:**

   - Implement a dynamic list component to display items.
   - Enable filtering functionality to refine the displayed items based on user-selected criteria.

2. **Scrollable List:**

   - Create a scrollable list component for My Record page to accommodate a large number of items.
   - Ensure smooth scrolling experience for users.

3. **Chart Display:**

   - Integrate a chart library to visualize data in the chart section of My Record page.
   - Generate visual representations based on the provided data.

4. **Sortable List:**

   - Implement functionality to allow users to sort the list items based on different attributes.
   - Provide interactive sorting options for a better user experience.

5. **Column Layout:**
   - Design a column layout for the Column Page to organize and display items effectively.
   - Ensure responsiveness for various screen sizes.

## Technologies Used:

- React.js: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and styling web content.
- Charting Library: Utilize a charting library for visualizing data.
- Dummy Data Generation: Generate sample data to populate the website for testing and demonstration.

## Project Deliverables:

- Fully functional React.js application with three pages: Top Page, My Record, and Column Page.
- Implementation of design elements and functionality described in the provided markdown document.
- Well-documented code with comments explaining key functionality and design decisions.
- Deployment-ready build of the website for testing and demonstration purposes.

## Conclusion:

This project aims to demonstrate proficiency in building a multi-page website using React.js while adhering to a provided design specification. By implementing the described functionality and design elements, the resulting website will provide users with an intuitive and interactive experience across the Top Page, My Record, and Column Page.
